Urine output of 30 mL/hr is normal, clubbing appearance involves the respiratory system, and tactile stimulation involves the nervous system. ,Reduction of risk, application, implementation,
2. When teaching an older adult patient about coronary artery disease you should include which of the following instructions. ,A.Chest pain is the most common symptom experienced. ,B.You may have fewer side effects from the use of oral beta blockers. ,C. When performing exercise you will need to plan longer warm up time.,D.Dysrhythmias are an abnormal symptom for your age. ,Ans: C ,Iggy pg 861,Rationale: This age group needs to allow for the steady increase and decrease in their heart rate pre and post exercise. Chest pain is not the most common symptom; they may have unexplained dyspnea, confusion or GI symptoms. This age group may have greater side effects with the use of beta blockers, dysrhythmias are normal for this age group. ,Health Promotion and Maintenance, application, implementation (Teaching),
3.A patient with atherosclerosis asks a nurse which factors are responsible for this condition. What is the nurse’s best response?,A.“Injury to the arteries causes them to spasm, reducing blood flow to the extremities.”,B.“Excess fats in your diet are stored in the lining of your arteries, causing them to constrict.”,C.“A combination of platelets and fats accumulate, narrowing the artery and reducing blood flow.”,D.“Excess sodium from hypertension causes direct injury to the arteries, reducing blood flow and eventually causing obstruction.”,ANS:C,Iggy: pp. 793-794,Rationale: Most researchers believe that a combination of platelet and lipid accumulation following intimal injury is responsible for the process of atherosclerosis.,Health Promotion and Maintenance, Application, Implementation (Teaching/Learning),
4.What specific instructions should the nurse provide to the patient with atherosclerosis who is attempting to stop cigarette smoking with the use of a nicotine patch? ,A.“Abruptly discontinuing this patch can cause high blood pressure.”,B.“Abruptly discontinuing this patch can cause nausea and vomiting.”,C.“Smoking while using this patch increases the risk of respiratory infections.”,D. “Smoking while using this patch increases the risk of a heart attack.”,ANS: D,Iggy Chpt 40,Rationale: Nicotine constricts blood vessels, increases mean arterial pressure, and increases afterload. Smoking while using a nicotine patch increases afterload to such an extent that the myocardium must work harder, with coronary arteries constricted. This may cause a myocardial infarction.,Health Promotion and Maintenance, Application, Implementation (Teaching/Learning),
5.The nurse correlates which pathophysiologic processes with the development of coronary artery disease (CAD)?,A. Atherosclerotic plaques cause spasm and subsequent narrowing of the coronary vessels. ,B.Coronary vessels becomes inflamed and injured as a result of excess cholesterol and ,triglycerides.,C.Macrophages and T cells form a connective tissue matrix in the vessel intima where ,lipids accumulate. ,D.Atherosclerosis causes coronary vessels to become stiff, limiting their ability to respond ,to increases in blood flow. ,ANS: C,Iggy Chpt 40,Rationale: Atherosclerosis leading to CAD is the result of three processes: (1) the overgrowth of intimal,smooth muscle cells with macrophages and T cells; (2) the formation of a connective tissue in the vessel,intima; and (3) the accumulation of lipids, which serve to narrow the vessel lumen. ,Physiological Adaptation, Assessment, Application,
6. A patient is admitted with early-stage heart failure. Which assessment finding does the nurse expect?,A.A drop in blood pressure and urine output.,B. An increase in creatinine and lower extremity edema.,C.An increase in heart rate and respiratory rate. ,D.An increase in oxygen saturation. ,ANS: C,Iggy Chpt 37,Rationale: In heart failure, stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system represents the most immediate response. Adrenergic receptor stimulation causes an increase in heart rate and respiratory rate. The blood pressure will remain the same or elevate slightly. ,Physiological Adaptation, Assessment, Application,
7.Which patient statement alerts the nurse to possible heart failure?,A.“I’m drinking more water than usual.”,B. “I’ve been awakened by the need to urinate at night.”,C.“I have to stop halfway up the stairs to catch my breath.”,D.“I have experienced blurred vision on several occasions.”,ANS: C,Iggy Chpt 37,Rationale: Patients with left-sided heart failure report weakness or fatigue while performing normal activities of daily living as well as difficulty breathing, or “catching their breath.” This occurs as fluid moves into the alveoli.,Health Promotion and Maintenance, Application, Assessment,
9.What physiological response is most likely to occur following surgery?,A.Increase in oxygen use.,B.Increase in immune response.,C.Decrease in blood sugar.,D.Decrease in coagulation rate.,ANS: A,Iggy pg 286,Rationale: The need for oxygen is a physiological response to surgery. The immune system has a decreased response, blood sugar levels increase due to a drop in insulin, and coagulation increases as blood becomes more viscous. ,Basic Care and Comfort, Knowledge, Assessment,
10.The nurse is speaking with a patient who is scheduled for surgery. The patient has expressed concern that they might receive blood products, an act prohibited by their religion. Which of the following is the nurse’s best response?,A.“There are ways to replace blood loss besides blood products.”,B.“Your chance of needing a blood transfusion is small.”,C.“You need to do what is necessary to save your life.”,D.“You could have family members donate blood for you.”,ANS: A,Iggy pg 247,Rationale: There are many ways to replace blood loss such as “bloodless surgery” and minimally invasive surgery, the use of various techniques are also used to reduce the need for transfusion. The patient could also use Epogen or Procrit to increase the red blood cell production. Newer equipment and surgical techniques can allow surgeons to recycle the patients’ blood during surgery.,Physiological Adaptation, Application, Implementation,
11.The nurse is obtaining a patient’s history prior to an elective surgery and the patient states the  ,following facts. Which fact should be reported to the surgeon and may result in the cancellation of the surgery? ,A.“I delivered a baby eight weeks ago and I still have some vaginal discharge.”,B.“I have been taking my oral contraceptives for the last two weeks.”,C. “I have three large boils (furuncles) on the skin of my left shoulder.”,D.“I am allergic to aspirin, silk tape, dust, peanuts, and fall pollens.”,ANS: C,Iggy pg 251,Rationale: A boil or furuncle is a deep skin infection. The most common organism in a boil is Staphylococcus aureus. The presence of this infection places the patient at risk for a wound infection, even when the boil is not located near the planned surgical site. The infection should be treated and cleared before surgery. Because this surgery is elective rather than urgent or emergent, it can be delayed without harming the patient.,Risk Reduction, Application, Planning,
12.The nurse is caring for a postoperative client in the recovery room. Initial assessment shows that the patient is restless, has a thready pulse of 122, noisy respirations of 36, and a blood pressure of 116/74. What should the nurse do next?,A.Increase the fluid volume by increasing the IV rate.,B.Inspect the nasal passage for possible obstruction. ,C.Check the dressing for the possibility of hemorrhage.,D.Administer additional pain medication as ordered.,ANS: B,Iggy pg 286-287,Rationale: Restlessness and noisy respirations are usual signs of obstruction and poor circulation. ,Risk Reduction, Application, Assessment,
13.The health care provider has ordered a one-day postoperative client to ambulate four times per day. What is the best nursing action to take when the client becomes dizzy while being assisted from the bed for the first time?,A.Assist the client quietly back to bed and reassess.,B.Notify the health care provider that client was dizzy.,C.Suggest the client take three or four deep breaths. ,D.Have the client sit in a chair until dizziness subsides.,ANS: D,Rationale: It is not unusual for a client to feel dizzy during initial ambulation after surgery due to postural hypotension.  Sitting in a chair will allow the body to adjust to the change in fluid distribution.,Reduction of Risk, Application, Implementation,
14. The nurse is assessing a client before surgery and observes dark blue, distended veins on the lower legs and ankles. Postoperatively, the nurse would monitor the client for what development? ,A.Respiratory complications.,B.Hypotension and cardiac dysrhythmias.,C.Fluid and electrolyte imbalance. ,D.Deep vein thrombosis. ,Iggy pg: 289,ANS: D,Rationale: These signs may indicate poor circulation in the lower extremities that would place the client at a higher risk for developing clot formation following surgery. ,Reduction of Risk, Application, Assessment,
15.The nurse is monitoring a client in hypovolemic shock who has been placed on a dopamine hydrochloride drip. Which of the following parameters should the nurse recognizes as the desired response to this drug?,A.Hypotension.,B.Tachycardia.,C.Increased cardiac output.,D.Palmar erythema.,Iggy pg 837,ANS: C,Rationale: Dopamine increases myocardial oxygen consumption which would increase cardiac output. ,Pharmacology, Application, Analysis,
16.The nurse is administering a unit of packed red blood cells and the patient complains of chills, headache and nausea. Which of the following is the nurse’s first nursing action?,A.Continue the infusion and obtain a set of vital signs.,B.Stop the infusion stat and notify the health care provider.,C.Slow the infusion and assess for cessation of symptoms.,D.Stop the infusion and allow the child quiet time to rest. ,Iggy pg 920-921,ANS: C,Rationale:  The feeling of chills, a headache, and nausea may or may not be a reaction. Assessment of the vital signs provides more definitive data to further assess the patient for a transfusion reaction. ,Physiological Adaptation, Application, Implementation ,
17.The nurse is teaching a patient about the newly prescribed medication, atorvastatin (Lipitor). Which instruction needs to be included in the teaching?,A.“Taking this medication can cause constipation.”,B.“Always take this medication on an empty stomach.”,C.“Report any muscle tenderness to your health care provider.”,D.“You may experience flushing of the skin with this medication.”,Iggy pg 796,ANS: C,Rationale: Statin medications can cause muscle myopathies and should be discontinued if the patient has any muscle cramping.,Pharmacology, Application, Implementation (Teaching),
18. The nurse hears a swishing sound over the right carotid artery while performing auscultation on a patient with atherosclerosis. Which of the following would be the nurse’s best action?,A.Performing carotid massage.,B.Notifying the health care provider.,C.No action is necessary because this is a normal finding.,D.Simultaneously palpating the carotid arteries bilaterally.,Iggy pg 795,ANS: B,Rationale: A swishing sound can be a sign of a bruit forming and is abnormal. This finding could indicate an arterial occlusion. ,Reduction of Risk, Application, Assessment,
19.The nurse on the telemetry unit is assessing blood pressure readings on four patients with cardiac problems. Which blood pressure reading suggests to the nurse that the patient’s mean arterial pressure is abnormal and warrants notifying the physician? ,A.94/58 mm Hg.,B.98/36 mm Hg.,C.108/54 mm Hg.,D.140/80 mm Hg.,Iggy pg 706,ANS: B,Rationale: To maintain adequate blood flow through the coronary arteries the mean arterial pressure must be at least 60 mm Hg. A mean arterial pressure between 60 and 70 mm Hg is necessary to maintain perfusion of major body organs, such as the brain and kidneys. ,Physiological Integrity, Analysis, Analysis,
20.At 0730 hours, a nurse receives a verbal order for a cardiac catheterization to be completed on a patient at 1400 hours. Which action should the nurse initiate first? ,
A.Start an intravenous infusion of 0.9% NaCl.,B.Ask the patient to sign a consent form. ,C.Initiate NPO status for the patient.,D.Teach the patient about the procedure.,Iggy pg 723,ANS: C,Rationale: A cardiac catheterization is an invasive procedure and to avoid aspiration the patient should be NPO 6 to 12 hours prior to the procedure. NPO status would be the first action the nurse would initiate with the signing of the consent form and starting an IV after the cardiologist has seen the patient and orders have been written. The cardiologist would also teach the patient about the procedure. ,Safe and Effective Care, Implementation, Analysis,
21. A patient has received health teaching about lifestyle changes that can help reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. Which of these statements made by the patient indicates a need for further teaching by the nurse? ,A. “I have to watch what I eat so that I can lose some weight.”,
B.“I quit smoking last year because I have smoked since I was 12.”,C. “I can’t do anything about my disease risk because it’s in my genes.”,D.“I have to take my blood pressure medication as the doctor wants me to.”,Iggy pg 709 ,ANS: C,Rationale: Although nothing can be done to modify genetic risks of heart disease, other risk factors can be considerably lowered, such as cigarette smoking, inactivity, obesity, and psychological factors. The patient does have to watch his diet to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. Obesity and a diet high in sodium, sugar, and cholesterol will contribute to heart disease. The patient realizes that smoking is a modifiable risk factor.  The patient understands the importance of taking blood pressure medications as prescribed to maintain lower blood pressure and prevent the complications of hypertension.,Reduction of Risk, Application, Implementation (Teaching),
22. A middle-aged patient who has a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is admitted to the telemetry unit for an abnormal heart rhythm and chest discomfort. What physical assessment findings should the nurse expect for this patient? (Select all that apply.),A. Headache,B. Palpitations,C. Orthopnea,D. Diarrhea,E. Fatigue,F. Hypercapnia,Iggy pg 712-713,ANS: A, B, C, E,Rationale: The most common findings would be palpitations, orthopnea, and fatigue. Depending on the patient’s history, medications, and duration of cardiac disease, headache could also be present. Diarrhea may possibly be caused by medication, food, etc. that might lower the potassium, which may lead to headaches and hypercapnia.  Hypercapnia is due to hypokalemia and hypoxemia.,Reduction of Risk Potential, Application, Assessment,
23.A client’s ECG monitor shows asystole, the patient becomes unresponsive and is not breathing. What is the nurse’s first priority?,A. Begin chest compressions.,B.Establish an airway.,C.

Which of the following tests should the nurse anticipate the health care provider to order? ,Upper GI series.,Laparoscopy.,Endoscopy.,Gastroscopy.,ANS: C,Iggy pg 1350,Rationale: Endoscopy would be done first to identify the source of the bleeding.  Gastroscopy is too specific and the other tests would not be appropriate for possible esophageal varices. ,Management of Care, Application, Assessment,
29.The nurse is performing discharge teaching for a client with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) who will be taking, pantoprazole (Protonix), and aluminum hydroxide (Maalox). Which of the following statements by the client indicates understanding of the teaching?,A.“I should not take the Maalox with the other medications.”,B.“The Protonix will kill the E.Coli germ that caused the ulcers.”,C.“Protonix works by coating the lining of my stomach.”,D.“I should decrease the dose of Maalox if the pain is not relieved.”,ANS: A,Iggy pg 1274-1275,Rationale: Antacids buffer gastric acid and prevent the formation of pepsin. Maalox when administered alone will increase the GI side effects and when administered in combination can overcome the unpleasant side effects. ,Pharmacology, Application, Evaluation (Teaching),A client with a recent diagnosis of early peptic ulcer disease needs health teaching about nutrition therapy. Which of the following foods should the nurse teach the client to avoid? (Select all that apply),Red chili peppers.,Orange juice without pulp.,Green beans.,Fried chicken.,Scrambled eggs.,Warm brewed tea.,Garlic bread. ,ANS: A, B, D, F, G,Iggy pg 1275,Rationale: Although there is no evidence that dietary restriction reduces gastric acid secretion or promotes tissue healing, a bland diet may assist in relieving symptoms. Patients should be taught to avoid substances that increase gastric acid secretion, such as those listed above. Green beans and scrambled eggs do not stimulate gastric acid secretion because they are bland and nonirritating.,Health Promotion and Maintenance, Application, Assessment,The nurse is caring for a client recently diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease (PUD).  Which of the following assessment findings requires an immediate nursing action?,       Client vomits 100 mL of bright red fluid.,       Client has blood pressure of 170/70 in left arm.,
       Client has hemoglobin of 8.8 mg/dL. ,       Client passes 400 mL of loose green stool. ,ANS: A,Iggy pg 1271,Rationale: The most common complication of PUD are hemorrhage, perforation, pyloric obstruction, and intractable disease. Hemorrhage is the most serious complication. ,Physiological Adaptation, Application, Intervention  ,The nurse is caring for a client who is at risk for developing gastritis. Which finding from the client’s history leads the nurse to this conclusion?,The client is lactose-intolerant and cannot drink milk. ,The client recently traveled to Mexico and South America.,The client works at least 60 hours per week in a stressful job. ,The client takes naproxen sodium (Naprosyn) 500 mg daily for arthritis pain. ,ANS: D,Iggy pg 1266, 1268,Rationale: Motrin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause gastritis, even if symptoms are not yet apparent. Stress, travel, and spicy foods do not increase risk for gastritis. ,Health Promotion and Maintenance, Application, Assessment,The nurse is caring for a female client who has just received a prescription for misoprostol (Cytotec). Which instructions will the nurse provide to the client regarding this medication?,“You may dissolve the contents of the capsule in warm water if it is difficult to swallow.”,“Take this medication on an empty stomach just before going to bed every evening.”,“Make sure you use an effective form of birth control when taking this medication.”,“You should add fiber to your diet because this medication may cause constipation.”,ANS: C,Iggy pg 1274,Rationale: Cytotec may cause uterine rupture, miscarriage, and fetal deformities when taken during pregnancy. Clients should be careful not to become pregnant while taking the medication. Cytotec may cause diarrhea and should be taken with food.,Physiological Integrity, Application, Implementation (Teaching/Learning),
33.The nurse is caring for a patient with biliary colic. In managing the pain the client is experiencing ,which of the following would the nurse anticipate the health care provider to order?,A. Hydromorphone (Dilaudid).,B.Cholestyramine (Questran).,C. Meperidine  (Demerol).,D.Vitamins A, D, E, and K. ,ANS: A,Iggy pg 1369,Rationale: Biliary colic is severe pain caused by spasm of the ducts (usually R/T gallstones).  Acute biliary pain requires opioid analgesia such as morphine or hydromorphone (Dilaudid).  Demerol is thought to increase spasms of the sphincter of Oddi and is no longer used to relieve biliary pain and is thought to break down into a toxic metabolite (normeperidine) and can cause seizures, especially in older adults. Questran is an antilipemic, Vitamins A, D, E, and K will not relieve pain. ,Pharmacology, Application, Planning,The nurse is caring for a client recovering from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
