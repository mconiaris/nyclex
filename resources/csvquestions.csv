Circulatory system involves the assessment of peripheral pulses which would relate to the cardiac output. Urine output of 30 mL/hr is normal, clubbing appearance involves the respiratory system, and tactile stimulation involves the nervous system.
This age group needs to allow for the steady increase and decrease in their heart rate pre and post exercise. Chest pain is not the most common symptom; they may have unexplained dyspnea, confusion or GI symptoms. This age group may have greater side effects with the use of beta blockers, dysrhythmias are normal for this age group.
Most researchers believe that a combination of platelet and lipid accumulation following intimal injury is responsible for the process of atherosclerosis.
Nicotine constricts blood vessels, increases mean arterial pressure, and increases afterload. Smoking while using a nicotine patch increases afterload to such an extent that the myocardium must work harder, with coronary arteries constricted. This may cause a myocardial infarction.
Atherosclerosis leading to CAD is the result of three processes: (1) the overgrowth of intimal smooth muscle cells with macrophages and T cells; (2) the formation of a connective tissue in the vessel intima; and (3) the accumulation of lipids, which serve to narrow the vessel lumen.
In heart failure, stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system represents the most immediate response. Adrenergic receptor stimulation causes an increase in heart rate and respiratory rate. The blood pressure will remain the same or elevate slightly.
Patients with left-sided heart failure report weakness or fatigue while performing normal activities of daily living as well as difficulty breathing, or “catching their breath.” This occurs as fluid moves into the alveoli.
The need for oxygen is a physiological response to surgery. The immune system has a decreased response, blood sugar levels increase due to a drop in insulin, and coagulation increases as blood becomes more viscous.
There are many ways to replace blood loss such as “bloodless surgery” and minimally invasive surgery, the use of various techniques are also used to reduce the need for transfusion. The patient could also use Epogen or Procrit to increase the red blood cell production. Newer equipment and surgical techniques can allow surgeons to recycle the patients’ blood during surgery.
A boil or furuncle is a deep skin infection. The most common organism in a boil is Staphylococcus aureus. The presence of this infection places the patient at risk for a wound infection, even when the boil is not located near the planned surgical site. The infection should be treated and cleared before surgery. Because this surgery is elective rather than urgent or emergent, it can be delayed without harming the patient.
Restlessness and noisy respirations are usual signs of obstruction and poor circulation.
It is not unusual for a client to feel dizzy during initial ambulation after surgery due to postural hypotension.  Sitting in a chair will allow the body to adjust to the change in fluid distribution.
These signs may indicate poor circulation in the lower extremities that would place the client at a higher risk for developing clot formation following surgery.
Dopamine increases myocardial oxygen consumption which would increase cardiac output.
The feeling of chills, a headache, and nausea may or may not be a reaction. Assessment of the vital signs provides more definitive data to further assess the patient for a transfusion reaction.
Statin medications can cause muscle myopathies and should be discontinued if the patient has any muscle cramping.
A swishing sound can be a sign of a bruit forming and is abnormal. This finding could indicate an arterial occlusion.
To maintain adequate blood flow through the coronary arteries the mean arterial pressure must be at least 60 mm Hg. A mean arterial pressure between 60 and 70 mm Hg is necessary to maintain perfusion of major body organs, such as the brain and kidneys.
A cardiac catheterization is an invasive procedure and to avoid aspiration the patient should be NPO 6 to 12 hours prior to the procedure. NPO status would be the first action the nurse would initiate with the signing of the consent form and starting an IV after the cardiologist has seen the patient and orders have been written. The cardiologist would also teach the patient about the procedure.
Although nothing can be done to modify genetic risks of heart disease, other risk factors can be considerably lowered, such as cigarette smoking, inactivity, obesity, and psychological factors. The patient does have to watch his diet to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. Obesity and a diet high in sodium, sugar, and cholesterol will contribute to heart disease. The patient realizes that smoking is a modifiable risk factor.  The patient understands the importance of taking blood pressure medications as prescribed to maintain lower blood pressure and prevent the complications of hypertension.
The most common findings would be palpitations, orthopnea, and fatigue. Depending on the patient’s history, medications, and duration of cardiac disease, headache could also be present. Diarrhea may possibly be caused by medication, food, etc. that might lower the potassium, which may lead to headaches and hypercapnia.  Hypercapnia is due to hypokalemia and hypoxemia.
The initial priorities are ABC (airway, breathing, compressions).
Discharge instructions for patients with pacemakers include obtaining an ID bracelet and card, keep at least 6 inches away from handheld cellular phones, use ear on opposite side of pacemaker, and avoid strong electromagnetic fields such as MRI machines.

Rebound tenderness could be a sign that something has ruptured and/or bleeding  within the abdomen and will most likely need surgical intervention.
A quantitative fecal fat analysis is elevated in malabsorption due to unabsorbed fat causing steatorrhea or greater than normal amounts of fat in the feces.
The ammonia level is elevated and the serum albumin level is low both are indicative of advanced liver disease.
Endoscopy would be done first to identify the source of the bleeding.  Gastroscopy is too specific and the other tests would not be appropriate for possible esophageal varices.
Antacids buffer gastric acid and prevent the formation of pepsin. Maalox when administered alone will increase the GI side effects and when administered in combination can overcome the unpleasant side effects.
Although there is no evidence that dietary restriction reduces gastric acid secretion or promotes tissue healing, a bland diet may assist in relieving symptoms. Patients should be taught to avoid substances that increase gastric acid secretion, such as those listed above. Green beans and scrambled eggs do not stimulate gastric acid secretion because they are bland and nonirritating.
The most common complication of PUD are hemorrhage, perforation, pyloric obstruction, and intractable disease. Hemorrhage is the most serious complication.
Motrin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause gastritis, even if symptoms are not yet apparent. Stress, travel, and spicy foods do not increase risk for gastritis.
Cytotec may cause uterine rupture, miscarriage, and fetal deformities when taken during pregnancy. Clients should be careful not to become pregnant while taking the medication. Cytotec may cause diarrhea and should be taken with food.
Biliary colic is severe pain caused by spasm of the ducts (usually R/T gallstones).  Acute biliary pain requires opioid analgesia such as morphine or hydromorphone (Dilaudid).  Demerol is thought to increase spasms of the sphincter of Oddi and is no longer used to relieve biliary pain and is thought to break down into a toxic metabolite (normeperidine) and can cause seizures, especially in older adults. Questran is an antilipemic, Vitamins A, D, E, and K will not relieve pain.
The only choice that includes assessment is C. Assessment is the first step in responding to the client’s concern.
One of the priorities for caring for the patient with a T-tube is to assess the drainage system for pulling, kinking, or tangling on the right side.  Clamping the tube would not be on the first day post-operative, administering antiemetic medications are not warranted, and you never irrigate a t-tube.
Abdominal pain with peristaltic waves, nausea, and vomiting with abdominal distention are key features to a small bowel obstruction.
Encourage early ambulation to promote absorption of the carbon dioxide. None of the remaining interventions will relieve the pain.
Rebound tenderness is the most common cause appendicitis. Hyperacidity would cause epigastric pain, urinary retention does not cause lower right quadrant pain, and there is generally decreased bowel motility distal to an inflamed appendix.
Semi-fowler’s position aids in drainage and prevents the spread of infection throughout the abdominal cavity. This position allows for any of the local drainage to remain in the lower abdomen.
Bowel strictures are a common complication of Crohn’s disease and can result in an acute bowel obstruction.
The goal for diverticulitis is to promote bowel rest. Decreasing oral intake will allow for bowel resting. Antibiotics are part of the routine treatment regimen. Ambulation will not allow for bowel rest, nausea is not a concern with diverticulitis, and there is no need for deep breathing exercises.
Constipation may cause diverticulitis, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of diverticulosis.
Chicken salad and whole-wheat bread are high in fiber, which is the therapeutic diet prescribed for clients with diverticulosis. An adequate intake of water helps prevent constipation.
Red blood cell count of 2.9 million/cu mm is low and will impact the delivery of sufficient oxygen to the tissues. The remaining labs are within the normal limits.
The main focus for clients with acute pancreatitis is to control the pain and provide interventions that decrease GI tract activity, thus decreasing pancreatic stimulation. The client needs to be fasting and even smelling foods can cause enzyme production and increase pain related to pancreatic inflammation.
Zantac is the a H2 receptor blocker and decreases acid production. Protonix and Prilosec are proton pump inhibitors and Flagyl is an antifungal medication.
The pain for a duodenal ulcer is sudden, sharp and occurs 90-180 minutes after a meal, and often awakens the patient between 1 and 2 am.
Laennec’s cirrhosis, also known as alcoholic cirrhosis, is caused by the toxic effect of alcohol on the liver. The nurse should ask the client about a history of alcohol use.
Rest periods are an essential intervention to reduce the liver’s metabolic demands and increase its blood supply. Diet would be high caloric with moderate amounts of fats and proteins. Interferon alpha is administered to reduce the replication of the hepatitis B virus.
Hepatitis A is transmitted by the fecal-oral route via contaminated food or infected food handlers. Hepatitis B, C, and D are transmitted most commonly via infected blood or body fluids.
Hepatitis causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, right upper quadrant discomfort, and weight loss. Fatigue and malaise are common. Stools will be light or clay-colored if conjugated bilirubin is unable to flow out of the liver because of inflammation or obstruction of the bile ducts.
Although no special diet is required to treat viral hepatitis, it is generally recommended that clients consume a low-fat diet. Small frequent meals are preferable and may even prevent nausea. Frequently, appetite is better in the morning, so it is easier to eat a good breakfast. An adequate fluid intake of 2500-3000 mL/day that includes nutritional juices is also important.
